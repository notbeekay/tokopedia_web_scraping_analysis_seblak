# ðŸ“Š Tokopedia "Seblak" Web Scraping & Market Analysis
## ðŸš€ Project Overview
  I aim to increase my income by 5% within a year through dropshipping the Indonesian snack "seblak" on Tokopedia. 
  This project analyses the distribution and outliers of seblak's data (like price, quantity sold, and rating) through statistical data (like mean, median, standard deviation, 
  skewness, cofnidence interval and kurtosis), hypothesis testing, and Spearman's correlation to gain insight on the potential of the "Seblak" market and the income that can be obtained from dropshipping "Seblak".

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
  - Name: Seblak (on Tokopedia)
  - Source: [tokopedia](https://www.tokopedia.com/search?navsource=&page=2&q=seblak&search_id=20240725142332A392199A864D2909F4MR&srp_component_id=02.01.00.00&srp_page_id=&srp_page_title=&st=)

  1. Perform web scraping for data analysis of the product "seblak" on Tokopedia to find out the potential of the seblak market.
  2. Evaluate the impact of price, rating, and store location, etc.
  3. Provide data-driven recommendation whether to dropship seblak or not

## ðŸ“Š Methodology
  1. Descriptive Analysis: Sales distribution, correlation analysis
  3. Inferential Statistics: Two-Sample Independent Test (hypothesis testing) for store location analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Key Insights & Deliverables
  - Sales Distrubution analysis using skewness, kurtosis, standard deviation, and central tendency measurements
  - Correlation between Product Price and Quantity Sold
  - Confidence Interval for insight on potential earnings
  - Location analysis using Two-Sample Independent Test (hypothesis testing)
  
## ðŸ›  Tools Used
  - Python: Pandas, NumPy, Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Scipy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Jupyter Notebook: Statistical analysis

## ðŸ“œ Conclusion
  This analysis helped me decide not to dropship "seblak" and explore other products' markets as it is unlikely that I will achieve by 5% increase in income target within a year 
  given the low profit margin and low median sales.
